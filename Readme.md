# Call Data Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forest

## Project Purpose

This project aims to detect anomalies in call data using the Isolation Forest algorithm from scikit-learn. Anomalies in call data can indicate unusual patterns or issues that require further investigation, helping improve data integrity and operational efficiency.
